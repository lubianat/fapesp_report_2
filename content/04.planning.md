# Next steps  {.page_break_before}


After this groundwork, the next steps of this PhD project will be geared towards increased alignment with the representation of knowledge of the Human Cell Atlas. 
In particular, the next part of the project includes the following steps:

* Set up the semantic infrastructure on Wikidata for handling knowledge about cell types

    * Refine the theories of types/states/classes of cells within the constraints of ontologies and knowledge bases
    * Investigate the types of statements done about cell types
      * On Wikidata
      * On OBO Foundry ontologies
      * Freely on the biomedical literature
    * Craft wikidata relations ("properties") for making cell-type-related assertions (like "has marker" or "is the progenitor of")
  
* Devise ways to connect the Human Cell Atlas products to Wikidata and the Linked Open Data cloud
  * Write bots and scripts to reconcile data sources to Wikidata
  * Create tools for biocuration of Human Cell Atlas products combining text mining and expert curation
  * Project software for reuse of HCA-related knowledge integrated into common bioinformatics workflows.

* Provide proofs-of-concepts of how Wikidata integration can benefit the advancement of HCA
