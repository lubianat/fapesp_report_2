# Achievements {.page_break_before}



In the first year of the project, we addressed 3 different facets of the project. 

The first facet was the refinement of the fcoex R/Bioconductor framework, written for the detection of cell classes in single-cell RNA-seq data.
The second facet dealt with the concept of cell type itself, in the goal of building theoretical models for the formalization of knowledge. 
The third facet was aimed at the practical application of the concepts. 
We adapted a public database of cell type markers, Panglao DB, to the Wikidata format, made the information available through Wikidata and perfomed SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) queries to glance at the information on the database. 

## Fcoex: using coexpression to explore cell type diversity in scRNA-seq data

The fcoex (https://bioconductor.org/packages/fcoex/) was written by us to identify coexpression modules and cell populations in single-cell RNA-seq data. During the first year of this PhD projects, we worked on framing its use in the context of cell type representation and the Human Cell Atlas. The package was refactored and upgraded to conform to the new versions of R (now in 4.1.0) and Bioconductor (now in 3.12). We also developed the narrative and shaped the manuscript for submission. 

The fcoex method is designed for application right after a standard scRNA-seq clustering step (@fig:fcoex A). The cluster assignments convey information about the relations between cells to the algorithm and help to guide feature selection. Then, the package selects global marker genes specific to 1, 2, or more previously defined clusters. It ranks markers by symmetrical uncertainty, a non-linear correlation metric based on classical Shannon entropy. [@wikidata:Q106704674]

To find co-expression modules, fcoex inverts the FCBF feature selection algorithm, and instead of removing redundancy, it selects redundant (co-expressed) gene expression patterns. 
The default gene coexpression modules yielded by the pipeline are small by design (10s of genes per module) to facilitate manual exploration of the coexpression landscape. Each module has one “header” gene, which expression pattern better represents all the genes in the module.

Fcoex treats each module as a gene set to find cell populations, using only their expression to re-cluster cells. The new classifications are based, thus, on the genes (and functions) captured by each co-expression module.  The multiple module-based clusters serve as a platform for exploring the diversity of the dataset and identifying upper cell classes, grouping cells by common functions.

### Multi-hierarchies of blood types

To validate the fcoex pipeline, we selected the well-known pbmc3k dataset from the SeuratData R package, which contains around 2700 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with previously-defined cluster labels.

The standard fcoex pipeline detected nine modules that capture different parts of the cellular diversity in the dataset. 
For example, module M8 contains cytotoxicity genes, as PRF1 and GZMA, and splits the dataset into cytotoxic (NK and CD8) and non-cytotoxic cells. M2 (CD3D) splits the dataset in T-cells and non-T-cells. 
M5 (HLA-DRB1) groups together monocytes, B cells, and dendritic cells, all known antigen-presenting cells (APC) (@fig:fcoex B-E) 
The classifications provided by fcoex are easily reintegrated to Seurat to power visualizations and get  differentially expressed markers, providing more genes for the analysis, if desired. 

In general, fcoex clusters combined biologically similar cell types of the original dataset.
The clusterings help to explore and classify cells by function (@fig:fcoex E). 
Even in a well-studied dataset, fcoex provided a new light on the shared functionality of some NK cells and macrophages: they both markedly express the CD16-coding gene FCGR3A, whose product is a key player in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). [@wikidata:Q27341786] 
Thus, a complete functional classification of cells might want to include a “professional ADCC cells" class

To sum up, main goal of the fcoex pipeline is to use the modules to find biologically relevant populations, which then can be represented in ontologies, like the Cell Ontology [@wikidata:Q36067763], and by knowledge graphs, like Wikidata.
By doing so, fcoex offers new avenues to explore data-driven classifications of cells, aligning itself with  the challenges of the Human Cell Atlas and building catalogs of cell types in the single-cell era.

## Concept of cell types  {.page_break_before}


During the development of _fcoex_ we assumed the common notions of cell type, as a group of cells that share common features. The definition of the concept of "cell type", however, is currently a topic of debate by the biomedical community.[@wikidata:Q87649649; @doi:10.1242/dev.169854; @doi:10.1242/dev.178996; @wikidata:Q47565008; @wikidata:Q99418657; @wikidata:Q98665291; @wikidata:Q93086971; @wikidata:Q26770736; @wikidata:Q35688096; @wikidata:Q98633613; @wikidata:Q99418649; @wikidata:Q40436539].
In an opinion article published in Cell Systems in 2017, a series of researchers presented their views on the conceptual definition of 'cell type' in the context of a mature organism [@wikidata:Q87649649].
The opinions were varied, and no consensus was achieved.

Before we proceeded with the knowledge-graph formalizations via Wikidata, we dedicated time for a theoretical research on the concept of "cell type" in the context of knowledge representation. 
This line of research aligns itself with the groundwork of the Cell Ontology [@wikidata:Q21184168; @doi:10.1186/1471-2105-12-6; @doi:10.1186/s13326-016-0088-7] and CELDA [@wikidata:Q21284308]  and the contributions of the International Workshop on Cells in Experimental Life Sciences series [@doi:10.1186/s12859-017-1976-2; @doi:10.1186/s12859-019-2721-9].

In this period, we targeted the question: which cell type definition allows crafting coherent biological statements? 
The goal was to not say what cell types _are_, but what they can be for a consistent representation on a knowledge graph, like Wikidata.
We avoided the dissection of the differences between persistent classes of cells (often called "cell types") or the transient, fugacious classes of cells (often called "cell states") (see "Definition of cell identity" section in [@wikidata:Q48563763] for an example).
Even though such a distinction is an essential topic for theoretical research, it is not required to represent formally biomedical experiments.

To facilitate communication among life scientists, in a preprint derived from this PHD project[@doi:10.22541/au.160979530.02627436/v1], we proposed, among other theoretical advancements, naming conventions for different cell types classes. 
Much of the literature mixes cell types in one species (e.g., when dealing with a cell type as an evolutionary unit) or multiple species (e.g., in the Cell Ontology). 
It is useful to distill these different concepts into names. Given the importance of the species' concept in biological classification [@wikidata:Q1189395], we derive a species-centric view on the naming of classes of cell types. 
The four classes (Figure @fig:classes) we propose are as follows:

- archetypes, for when the taxonomic scope of the type is beyond the level of species; for example, "mammal neutrophils."
- _sensu stricto_ cell types, for when the taxonomic scope of the type corresponds to a single species; for example, _Mus musculus_ neutrophils."
- infratypes, for when the taxonomic scope is below the level of species; for example, considering the mouse strain "C57BL/6J", "neutrophils from C57BL/6J mice". 
- technotypes, for specific, experimentally defined cell types that harbor in their definition the precise conditions of the cells sampled; “2-month-old male C57BL/6J, Ly-6G<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup>  M-CSF R<sup>-</sup>  CD244<sup>-</sup> neutrophils”.

![ Names for classes of cell types.](images/archetypes_hn.jpg){#fig:classes}

The 4 different categories of cell types help us to better organize the knowledge about cell types. 
Even though individual articles and databases often have species-neutral names, the information often comes from experiments with a single strain of a single species.
Two articles might call by the same name cells that come from different animals, or were selected by different protocols. 
Large scale knowledge management requires an organized way of representing those details.

The division between archetypes and _sensu stricto_ cell types is of special importance in the context of biocuration and annotation of data. 
Associations like the  HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee and UniProt organize names and identifiers for genes and proteins in single species. 
Thus, if we want to annotate marker genes, for example, we need to associate them to a species-specific cell type (a _sensu stricto_ cell type) instead of the more vague association to a species-neutral type. 
That might seem obvious, but current standards still use identifiers that are species-neutral (e.g. in the reference HuBMAP app; <https://azimuth.hubmapconsortium.org/references/>)


The ontological discussion on the classes of cell types, thus, extends the current state-of-the-art and introduce new ways to organize our knowledge about cells. 
Notably, the technotype and the infratype are, currently, mostly theoretical constructs and almost no resources deal with cell types at the level of strains or below. 
The division of archetypes and _sensu stricto_ cell types, on the other hand, was already instrumental for the integration of the Panglao database of cell markers to Wikidata, described in the next session.

## PanglaoDB integration to Wikidata  {.page_break_before}

### Introduction

The process of making the Human Cell Atlas more useful via Wikidata also includes the connection of related databases. 

PanglaoDB [@https://panglaodb.se/index.html] [@doi:10.1093/database/baz046] is a publically-available database that contains data and metadata on hundreds of single-cell RNA sequencing experiments. 
It provides extensive information on cell types, genes, and tissues and cell type markers, obtained both via automatic and manual methods.
It also displays a rich web user interface for easy data acquisition, including database dumps for bulk downloads.


As of 17 June 2021, the article describing PanglaoDB had been cited 147 times. 
Despite its use by the community, the database is on a 3-star category for Linked Open Data [@url:https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html] as it does not use the open semantic standards from W3C (RDF and SPARQL) needed for a 4-star rank, neither the links to external data via standard identifiers that make datasets 5-star. 
Improving the data format toward W3C's gold standards is a valuable step in making biological knowledge FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). 
Thus, we aimed to provide a case study of making the core information of PandlaoDB available in a 5-star Linked Open Data Format while improving the modeling of the necessary concepts on Wikidata.

As of August 2020, Wikidata had 264 items being categorized as a "cell type", considerably less than in specialized cell catalogs, which count over two thousand cell types [@wikidata:Q28660708; @wikidata:Q36067763].
Strikingly, there were also 23 items categorized as "instances of cell (Q7868)" . This classification is imprecise, as an instance of cell would be an individual named cell from a single named individual.

Wikidata editors often mix first-order classes such as "cells" and "organs" with second-order classes like "cell types" and "organ types" (Supplementary Information). First-order classes point to real-world individuals, like the "Dolly sheep zygote" (a real-world "cell") and the "brain of Albert Einstein" (a real-world "organ"). Second-order classes point to classes, like "zygote" (a conceptual "cell type") and "brain" (a conceptual "organ type").

We diligently fixed and improved information on cell types on Wikidata. 
As of 17 June 2021, the Wikidata database contains 2102 instances of "cell type" (see current status at <https://w.wiki/b2t>) and 0 instances of "cell" (<https://w.wiki/b2q>) highlighting the improvements in both quantity and quality. 


### Methodology 

After obtaining approval from the owners of the database, we matched genes and cell types to Wikidata, and performed Wikidata queries to demonstrate the value of the approach. An overview of the process is shown in @fig:iscb_intro.

### Class creation on Wikidata

Classes corresponding to species-neutral classes were retrieved from Wikidata manually using Wikidata's Graphic User Interface. 
A manually-curated dictionary matching terms in PanglaoDB to Wikidata identifiers was assembled and used for integration. 
Cell types that were not represented on Wikidata were added to the database via the graphical user interface (<https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:NewItem>) and logged in the reference table.

Species-specific cell types for human and mouse cell types were created for every entry in the reference table and connected to the species-neutral concept via a "[subclass of](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/P279)" property (e.g. every single "[human neutrophil](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101405102)" is a also "[neutrophil](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q188417)"). 
Our approach was analogous to the one taken by the CELDA ontology to create species-specific cell-types [@wikidata:Q21284308].

#### Integration of PanglaoDB to Wikidata 

After receiving authorization by e-mail from the PanglaoDB developer, Oscar Franzen, the PanglaoDB markers dataset was downloaded manually from PanglaoDB's website (<https://panglaodb.se/markers/PanglaoDB_markers_27_Mar_2020.tsv.gz>) for integration. It contains 15 columns and 8256 rows. Only the columns `species`, `official gene symbol`, and  `cell type` were used for the reconciliation. 
The reconciled dataset was uploaded to Wikidata via the WikidataIntegrator Python package [@https://github.com/SuLab/WikidataIntegrator], a wrapper for the Wikidata Application Programming Interface. 

#### SPARQL queries

Besides the Wikidata Dumps, Wikidata provides an SPARQL endpoint with a Graphical User Interface (<https://query.wikidata.org/>). 
Updated data was immediately accessible via this endpoint, enabling integrative queries integrated with other database statements.
### Results

#### Cell Marker information on Wikidata

Adding marker information on Wikidata was not possible before this study and became possible after we proposed and got community approval of the property "has marker" (P8872).
Figure @fig:chat_marker shows 2 of the current markers of "human colinergic neuron"([Q101405051](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q101405051)), [CHAT](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q14863671) and [ACHE](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q407983), as they are seen on Wikidata.
The PanglaoDB is referenced both via URL to the website (<https://panglaodb.se/markers.html>) and a pointer to the PanglaoDB item on Wikidata, [Q99936939](http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q99936939).

Now that we re-formatted the markers on PanglaoDB as Linked Open Data, we can make queries that were not possible before, including
federated queries with other biological databases, such as Uniprot [@https://sparql.uniprot.org/sparql]
and Wikipathways [@https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Portal:Semantic_Web].
Due to previous similar reconciliation projects, Wikidata already contains information about genes, including their relations to Gene Ontology (GO) terms.

PanglaoDB's integration to the Wikidata ecosystem allows us to ask a variety of questions (figure @fig:iscb_results).

SPARQL queries in Wikidata now harness information from Panglao DB. Queries with the above design were run on Wikidata.

### "Which human cell types are related to neurogenesis via their markers?"

As expected, the query below retrieved a series of neuron types, such as "[human purkinje neuron](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q101404913)" and "[human cajal-retzius cell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q101405091)." It also retrieved non-neural cell types such as the "[human loop of henle cell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q101405109), a kidney cell type, and "[human osteoclast](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q101404928). These seemingly unrelated cell types markedly express genes involved in neurogenesis, but that does not mean that they are involved with this process. The seemingly confusing results reinforce the idea that one needs to be careful when using curated pathways to enrich one's analysis, as false positives abound.

The molecular process that gene products take part depends on the cell type. SPARQL allows us to seamlessly compare Gene Ontology processes with cell marker data, providing a sandbox to generate hypotheses and explore the biomedical knowledge landscape.

| geneLabel | cellTypeLabel                   |
| :-------- | :------------------------------ |
| OMP       | human purkinje neuron           |

### "Which cell types express markers associated with Parkinson's disease?"

Besides integration with Gene Ontology, Wikidata reconciliation makes it possible to complement the marker gene info on PanglaoDB with information about diseases. This integration is of biomedical interest, as there is a quest to detail mechanisms that link genetic associations and the diseases themselves.

"Disease genes" are often compiled from Genomic Wide Association Studies, which look for sequence variation in the DNA. These studies are commonly blind to the cell types related to the pathophysiology of the disease. In the query below, we can see cell types marked by genes genetically associated with Parkinson's disease. Even considering the false positives, the overview can aid domain experts in coming up with novel hypotheses.

| geneLabel | diseaseLabel        | cellTypeLabel    |
| :-------- | :------------------ | :--------------- |
| BST1      | Parkinson's disease | human b cell     |
| BST1      | Parkinson's disease | human neutrophil |
| RIT2      | Parkinson's disease | human neuron     |
| SH3GL2    | Parkinson's disease | human alpha cell |
| SH3GL2    | Parkinson's disease | human beta cell  |

## Discussion and conclusion

In this part of the PhD project, we re-released the knowledge curated in PanglaoDB on Wikidata, connecting it to the semantic web.
Each cell-type/marker statement was added to Wikidata with a pointer to PanglaoDB and a citation of the article, providing proper provenance.
Based on the theoretical considerations on the concept of cell type, we added species-specific terms to Wikidata for cell types of _Homo sapiens_ and _Mus musculus_ described in the PanglaoDB database.

This work exemplifies the power of releasing Linked Open Data via Wikidata, and provides the biomedical community with the first semantically accessible, 5-star LOD dataset of cell markers, easily reachable from Wikidata's SPARQL Query Service (<https://query.wikidata.org/>).
It is not first case study of biomedical data integration to Wikidata (see [@wikidata:Q105037759] for example.
Nevertheless, the differences among the articles in style and scope contribute to a richer ecosystem for possible contributor.
])
The work also paves the way for Wikidata reconciling of other databases for cell-type markers, such as CellMarker [@wikidata:Q56984510], labome [@doi:10.13070/mm.en.3.183], CellFinder [@wikidata:Q28660708] and SHOGoiN/CELLPEDIA [@https://stemcellinformatics.org/]) (if proper authorization are given by the owners).
The approach we took here can in essence be applied to any knowledge set of public interest, providing a low-cost and low-barrier platform for sharing biocurated knowledge in gold standard format.
